valhalla-black
==============

RaverX3X's Valhalla Black Edition was used as the base, adding in several firmware files from stock 2.3.4 KH2 for the T959P
The idea is to make a functional version for the T959P (Telus Fascinate 4G) including a functional GPS module which is the CG2900 as opposed to the Gns 2700
The kernel that will be used is the t959p version of bhundven's blastoff kernel
